# Hi there 👋 I'm Pratyush Jha

**AI Research Engineer @ Ola Krutrim · B.Tech (Engineering Physics), IIT Roorkee (2024)**

Working on the **intersection of AI and Physics** is especially exciting to me — I enjoy using mathematical insight to design better models and to connect theoretical ideas with practical systems. I currently explore **diffusion models for condensed-matter physics simulations**, and I spend a lot of time reading and thinking about the **mathematical structures that inspire reasoning in LLMs**.
