## Hi there 👋

I'm **Pratyush Jha**, an AI Research Engineer at **Ola Krutrim** with a B.Tech in Engineering Physics from IIT Roorkee.  
My interests include **model interpretability**, **LLM reasoning**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Natural Language Understanding**. I focus on building transparent and reliable AI systems.

### 🌐 Research Highlights
- **AI Research Engineer @ Ola Krutrim (2024–Present):**   
  Worked on improving LLM reasoning and reducing hallucinations using preference optimization techniques, while also building scalable AI systems and services—from model deployment pipelines to real‑time analytics and developer SDKs.
    
- **B.Tech Thesis (2023–24):**  
  Explored deep learning-based approaches to simulate phase diagrams in condensed matter physics. Compared fine-tuning and transfer learning strategies to improve model generalization and interpretability.

- **MITACS Globalink Intern @ McGill University (Summer 2023):**  
  Modeled CR‑39 neutron detectors with TOPAS-based Monte Carlo simulations to study detector response to high-energy and thermal neutrons.
